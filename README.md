Height in European Football

The topic in question is regarding soccer players in the top five European football leagues which are the English Premier 
League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, and Ligue 1. 
At the end of the  2022-2023 season, the league champions for England, Spain, Italy, Germany, and France were Manchester City, 
FC Barcelona, SSC Napoli, FC Bayern Munich, and Paris Saint-Germain FC. 

I am going to investigate the average height of each team in each league to determine if taller or shorter teams are more 
successful in European football. 
First, I will find each teamâ€™s average height. Then, I will reorder the teams in each league from tallest to shortest and 
compare these results to the actual standings the teams placed during the 2022-2023 season. Next, I will analyze these results
and determine if there is a pattern. 

For example, if the teams that placed highest for height are relatively similar to the teams that actually placed highest in real 
life, it is arguable that taller teams perform better in football. However, if there is no clear pattern and a mix of tall and 
short teams placed high in the actual leagues, then I will conclude that height is not a major determining factor in football 
success. 

At the end of the investigation, I will make appropriate graphs to visually represent my findings. The dataset I am using 
identifies the players and their height, club, position, and even what clothing brand they are sponsored by. There is much 
more information provided than what I would actually need for this investigation.
